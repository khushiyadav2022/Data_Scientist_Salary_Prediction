A data scientist has a very comprehensive job. Unlike other kinds of data specialists who specialize in a specific task (such as data engineers and data analysts), data scientists tackle the end-to-end lifecycle of a data science project right from data acquisition to model optimization to communicating insights to stakeholders. Because of this, data scientists are required to have a versatile skillset, and they pull down a pretty significant salary.

I have analysed the dataset from kaggle. According to my data analysis- 
- The US, The UK and Canada are the top three countries offering highest number of Data Science job. 
- Prefer to work remotely at a large company to get higher salary.
- Remote jobs have a higher mean salary than those who work on-site, and hybrid workers have a lower mean salary.
- Contract base salary is highest and part time salary is lowest.
